# libarchive.net

.Net wrapper for the excellent libarchive project

Currently, this provides _read only_ access to a wide variety of archive/compression formats: zip, rar, 7zip, tar, gzip, bzip2, lzo, lzma.


## TODO:

1. Write support
2. Building Windows DLL from source to match Mac and Linux
3. Additional platforms (32 bit x86, non-Mac ARM, Android, iOS?)
4. More comprehensive testing suite
5. Documentation

Any contributions to the above very welcome, whether in the form of PRs, suggestions (by email)[mailto:j@sutherland.pw] or through Github Sponsorship.
